# Documenting Reproducible Research with Jupyter Notebooks


This workshop will introduce Jupyter Notebooks, a platform for interactive computational research and data science. Jupyter Notebooks interweave code, data, and prose into an executable "notebook" that can be published or shared. Jupyter Notebooks are also a powerful tool for teaching programming, data science, and computational literacy. This workshop introduce participants to the Jupyter project (https://jupyter.org/), how to author Notebooks, and how to publish and share them on Github.
